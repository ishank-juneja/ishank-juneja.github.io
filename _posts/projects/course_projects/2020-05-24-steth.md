title: Electronic Stethoscope Front-End 
---

A traditional Stethoscope acquires body signals acoustically. The sounds reach a doctor’s ears through
rubber tubes. The ability to make accurate inferences from these sounds is limited by the physicians
experience.

The Goal of this project was to conceptualize an instrumentation circuit capable of filtering out and amplifying
Internal Body Sounds. Achieving this drastically reduces the dependence of diagnosis on the sensitivity
of a medical practitioner’s ear. 

The end result was a microphone fed electronic circuit capable of displaying heart sounds on an oscilloscope.
A major aspect of the project was identifying and eliminating sources of noise.
