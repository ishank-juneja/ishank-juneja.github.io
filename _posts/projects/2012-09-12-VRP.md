title: Vehicle Routing Problems
permalink: /projects/VRPs/ 
---

The aim of this supervised Learning project project was to come up with a formulation for a **corporate cab fleet problem**, which is a type of vehicle routing problem (VRP). 

VRPs are problems concerning the distribution of goods from depots to final users (customers). <br>
Solving a VRP is equivalent to determining a set of routes that start and end at the same depot,
such that operational constraints and customer requirements are satisfied and cost is minimized. 

The distribution network is modelled as a Graph with edges as roads and vertices
corresponding to customer locations. 

To work towards my goal I learnt about concepts like --<br>
	Linear Programming problems, the simplex algorithm for constraint optimization, Integer programming (IP) for discrete optimization, Network Problem IP models, the travelling salesman problem and Branch and bound and cutting plane algorithms for solving IP problems. 

Some of the graphics I made as part of [my notes](https://github.com/ishank-juneja/cab-fleet-optimization/tree/master/notes) for this are shown below.
