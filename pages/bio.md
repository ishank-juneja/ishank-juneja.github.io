# Ishank Juneja

I am a final year undergraduate student at the [Electrical Engg. Dept. IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web). My interests lie in the areas of reinforcement learning and online decision making with the broader goal of developing systems which have embodied intelligence. 

Outside of projects and course work I enjoy playing Squash. The fast paced indoor raquet game is well suited to the often rainy weather here in Mumbai. I currently write about things that interest me on my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/)
