# Ishank Juneja

I am a third year undergraduate student at the [Electrical Engg. Dept. IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web). Aside from major I am also doing a minor in Computer Science. Through the integrated Masters program here at IITB, I will be specialising in Communication and Signal processing, an area which I am passionate about.

Since I am interested in Signal Processing, I have done some projects in Digital Image processing. These projects have been through [an Internship]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/baby-image), a [self initiated project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/ITSP) and course work.

Most Recently as a summer project, I studied some optimization problems using Integer Programming. [Details Here]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/VRPs) 

Many courses at IITB have a hands on project component. Some of the most Interesting ones are [Summarised Here]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/course)   

Outside of projects and course work I enjoy playing Squash. The fast paced indoor raquet game is well suited to the often rainy weather here in Mumbai. I used to [write on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ishank-Juneja) Where my posts have become slightly popular.
